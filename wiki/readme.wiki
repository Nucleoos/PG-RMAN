pg_rman -- manages backup and recovery of PostgreSQL.

= Synopsis =
{{{
pg_rman [ OPTIONS ] { init | backup | restore | show [ DATE | timeline ] | validate [ DATE ] | delete DATE }
}}}

pg_rman has the features below:
  * Takes a backup while database including tablespaces with just one command.
  * Can recovery from backup with just one command.
  * Supports incremental backup and compression of backup files so that it takes less disk spaces.
  * Manages backup generations and shows a catalog of the backups.
  * Supports storage snapshot.

DATE is the start time of the target backup in ISO-format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS).
Prefix match is used to compare DATE and backup files.
{{{
$ pg_rman show 2009-12 # show backups in a month of December 2009
$ pg_rman validate     # validate all unvalidated backups
}}}

pg_rman supports the following commands.
See also Options for details of OPTIONS.

init
    Initialize a backup catalog.
backup
    Take an online backup.
restore
    Do restore.
show
    Show backup history.<br/>The timeline option shows timeline of the backup and the parent's timeline for each backup.
validate
    Validate backup files.
delete
    Delete backup files.

= Description =
pg_rman is a utility program to backup and restore PostgreSQL database.
It takes a physical online backup of whole database cluster, archive WALs, and server logs.

And pg_rman supports storage snapshot backup.

== Initialize a backup catalog ==
First, you need to create "a backup catalog" to store backup files and their metadata.

It is recommended to setup archive_mode and archive_command in postgresql.conf before initialize the backup catalog. If the variables are initialized, pg_rman can adjust the config file to the setting.

{{{
$ pg_rman init -B <a backup catalog path>
}}}

== Backup ==
Backup target can be one of the following types. Also serverlogs can be added.

Full backup
    Backup a whole database cluster.
Incremental backup
    Backup only files or pages modified after the last verified backup.
Archive WAL backup
    Backup only archive WAL files.

It is recommended to verify backup files as soon as possible after backup.
Unverified backup cannot be used in restore nor in incremental backup.

== Restore ==
PostgreSQL server should be stopped before restore.
If database cluster still exists, restore command will save unarchived transaction log and delete all database files. You can retry recovery until a new backup is taken.
After restoring files, pg_rman create recovery.conf in $PGDATA.
The conf file contains parameters to recovery, and you can also modify the file if needed.

It is recommended to take a full backup as soon as possible after recovery is succeeded.

If "--recovery-target-timeline" is not specifed, the last checkpoint's TimeLineID in control file ($PGDATA/global/pg_control) will be a restore target.
If pg_control is not present, TimeLineID in the full backup used by the restore will be a restore target.

= Examples =
To reduce the number of command line arguments, you can set BACKUP_PATH, an environment variablle, to the absolute path of the backup catalog and write default configuration into ${BACKUP_PATH}/pg_rman.ini.

{{{
$ cat $BACKUP_PATH/pg_rman.ini
ARCLOG_PATH = /home/postgres/arclog
SRVLOG_PATH = /home/postgres/pgdata/pg_log

BACKUP_MODE = F
COMPRESS_DATA = YES
KEEP_ARCLOG_FILES = 10
KEEP_ARCLOG_DAYS = 10
KEEP_DATA_GENERATIONS = 3
KEEP_DATA_DAYS = 120
KEEP_SRVLOG_FILES = 10
KEEP_SRVLOG_DAYS = 10
}}}

Take a backup. This example takes a full backup of the whole database with serverlogs. Then, it validates all unvalidated backups.

{{{
$ pg_rman backup --backup-mode=full --with-serverlog
$ pg_rman validate

}}}

Discatd the all database and restore from a backup.

{{{
$ pg_ctl stop -m immediate
$ pg_rman restore
$ pg_ctl start 
}}}

You can retrieve a backup catalog with show command.

{{{
$ pg_rman show

2009-05-31 17:05:53    3m  1242MB    ----    32MB    ----   242MB   OK
}}}

The fields are:
  * Start : start time of backup
  * Time  : total time of backup
  * Total : size of whole database cluster
  * Data  : size of read data files
  * WAL   : size of read WAL archive files
  * Log   : size of read serverlog files
  * Backup: size of backup (= written size)
  * Status: status of backup. Possible values are:
    * OK : backup is done and validated.
    * DONE : backup is done, but not validated yet.
    * RUNNING : backup is running now.
    * DELETING : backup is being deleted now.
    * DELETED : backup has been deleted.
    * ERROR : backup is unavailable because some errors occur during backup.
    * CORRUPT : backup is unavailable because it is broken.
  

The delete command deletes backup files not required by recovery after the specified date. The following example deletes unneeded backup files to recovery at 12:00 11, September 2009.

= Options =
pg_rman accepts the following command line parameters.
Some of them can be also sepcified as environment variables.
See also Parameters for the details.

== Common options ==
As a general rule, paths for data location need to be specified as absolute paths; relative paths are not allowed.
-D PATH / --pgdata=PATH
    The absolute path of database cluster. Required on backup and restore.

-A PATH / --arclog-path=PATH
    The absolute path of archive WAL directory. Required on backup and restore.

-S PATH / --srvlog-path=PATH
    The absolute path of server log directory. Required on backup with server logs and restore.

-B PATH / --backup-path=PATH
    The absolute path of backup catalog. Always required.

-c / --check
    If specifed, pg_rman doesn't perform actual jobs but only checks parameters and required resources. The option is typically used with --verbose option to verify the operation.

== Backup options ==
-b { full | incremental | archive } / --backup-mode={ full | incremental | archive }
    Specify backup target files. Available options are: "full" backup, "incremental" backup, and "archive" backup. Abbreviated forms (prefix match) are also available. For example, -b f means "full" backup.
  * full : Whole database backup and archive backup
  * incremental : Incremental backup and archive backup
  * archive : Only archive backup

-s / --with-serverlog
    Backup server log files if specified.

-Z / --compress-data
    Comress backup files with zlib if specified.

-C / --smooth-checkpoint
    Checkpoint is performed on every backups. If the option is specified, do smooth checkpoint then. See also the second argument for <a href="http://developer.postgresql.org/pgdocs/postgres/functions-admin.html">pg_start_backup()</a>.

--keep-data-generations / --keep-data-days
    Specify how long backuped data files will be kept. --keep-data-generations means number of backup generations. --keep-data-days means days to be kept. Only files exceeded both settings are deleted.

--keep-arclog-files / --keep-arclog-days
    Specify how long backuped archive WAL files will be kept. --keep-arclog-files means number of backup files. --keep-arclog-days means days to be kept. When you do backup, only files exceeded both settings are deleted from archive storage.

--keep-srvlog-files / --keep-srvlog-days
    Specify how long backuped serverlog files will be kept. --keep-srvlog-files means number of backup files. --keep-srvlog-days means days to be kept. When you do backup, only files exceeded both settings are deleted from server log directory (log_directory).

== Restore options ==
Those parameters are same as parameters in recovery.conf.
See also "<a href="http://developer.postgresql.org/pgdocs/postgres/continuous-archiving.html#RECOVERY-CONFIG-SETTINGS">Continuous Archiving and Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR)#Recovery Settings</a>" for details.

--recovery-target-timeline TIMELINE
    Specifies recovering into a particular timeline.
If not specified, the current timeline Use ($PGDATA/global/pg_control) is used.

--recovery-target-time TIMESTAMP
    This parameter specifies the time stamp up to which recovery will proceed.
If not specified, continue recovery to the latest time.

--recovery-target-xid XID
    This parameter specifies the transaction ID up to which recovery will proceed. 
If not specified, continue recovery to the latest xid.

--recovery-target-inclusive
    Specifies whether we stop just after the specified recovery target (true), or just before the recovery target (false). Default is true.

== Catalog options ==
-a /  --show-all
    Show also deleted backups.

== Connection options ==
Parameters to connect PostgreSQL server.

-d DBNAME / --dbname=DBNAME
    The database name to execute pg_start_backup() and pg_stop_backup().

-h HOSTNAME / --host=HOSTNAME
    Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain socket. 

-p PORT / --port=PORT
    Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file extension on which the server is listening for connections. 

-U USERNAME / --username=USERNAME
    User name to connect as. 

-w / --no-password
    Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires password authentication and a password is not available by other means such as a .pgpass file, the connection attempt will fail. This option can be useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a password.

-W / --password
    Force pg_rman to prompt for a password before connecting to a database.
This option is never essential, since pg_rman will automatically prompt for a password if the server demands password authentication. However, pg_rman will waste a connection attempt finding out that the server wants a password. In some cases it is worth typing -W to avoid the extra connection attempt.

== Generic options ==
--help
    Print help, then exit.

-V / --version
    Print version information, then exit.

-! / --debug
    Show debug information.

  * The names of variable in configuration file are the same as long names or names of environment variables.
  * The password can not be specified in command line and configuration file for security reason.

This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also uses the environment variables supported by libpq  (see <a href="http://developer.postgresql.org/pgdocs/postgres/libpq-envars.html">Environment Variables</a>)

= Restrictions =
pg_rman has the following restrictions.

Requires to read database cluster directory and write backup catalog directory.
    For example, you need to mount the disk where backup catalog is placed with NFS from database server.

Major versions of pg_rman and server should be matched.
    pg_rman cannot backup servers with different major versions.

Block sizes of pg_rman and server should be matched.
    BLCKSZ and XLOG_BLCKSZ also should be matched.

When using storage snapshot, pg_rman has the following restrictions too.
    * If your snapshot does not have any file update time, incremental backup is same with full backup.
    ** Because pg_rman judges performing full backup or incremental backup by update time for files. If files don't have update time because of storage snapshot specification, pg_rman performs full backup every time.
    * You can't backup for one side works storage with split mirror snapshot.
    ** Before you execute pg_rman, you should perform storage "RESYNC".
    * After pg_rman performs backup with split mirror snapshot, storeage will be "SPLITTED"(works on one side).
    ** pg_rman perform SPLIT command for getting snapshot, but doesn't perform RESYNC command.
    * You cant't get snapshot from different vendor storages in a time.
    ** You cant't use some vendor storages which have different commands for getting snapshot.
    * The script and commands for getting storage snapshot shold be executable.
    ** It's expected to have authority of root for getting snapshot or mounting volumes. So a user, performs pg_rman, is granted to execute any commands in the script.
    ** If you use LVM(Logical Volume Manager),  it's needed root authority for mount, umount, lvcreate, lvremove, lvscan commands. You shold granted to these commands with sudo command to non-password executable.


= Details =
== Recovery to Point-in-Time ==
pg_rman can recover to point-in-time if timeline, transaction ID, or timestamp are specified in recovery.
<a href="http://pgfoundry.org/projects/xlogviewer/">xlogdump</a> is an useful tool to  check the contents of WAL files and determine when to recover.
See <a href="http://developer.postgresql.org/pgdocs/postgres/continuous-archiving.html">Continuous Archiving and Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR)</a> for the details.

== Configuration file ==
Setting parameters can be specified with form of "name=value" in the configuration file.
Quotes are required if the value contains whitespaces.
Comments starts with "#".
Whitespaces and tabs are ignored excluding values.

== Exit codes ==
pg_rman returns exit codes for each error status.

|| *Code* || *Name* || *Description* ||
||  0 || SUCCESS || Succeeded. ||
||  1 || HELP || Print a help, then exit. ||
||  2 || ERROR || Generic error. ||
||  3 || FATAL || Exit because of repeated errors ||
||  4 || PANIC || Unknown critical condition. ||
|| 10 || ERROR_SYSTEM || I/O or system error. ||
|| 11 || ERROR_NOMEM || Out of memory. ||
|| 12 || ERROR_ARGS || Invalid input parameters. ||
|| 13 || ERROR_INTERRUPTED || Interrupted by user. (Ctrl+C etc.) ||
|| 14 || ERROR_PG_COMMAND || SQL error. ||
|| 15 || ERROR_PG_CONNECT || Cannot connect to PostgreSQL server. ||
|| 20 || ERROR_ARCHIVE_FAILED || Cannot archive WAL files. ||
|| 21 || ERROR_NO_BACKUP || Backup file not found. ||
|| 22 || ERROR_CORRUPTED || Backup file is broken. ||
|| 23 || ERROR_ALREADY_RUNNING || Cannot start because another pg_rman is running. ||
|| 24 || ERROR_PG_INCOMPATIBLE || Version conflicted with PostgreSQL server. ||
|| 25 || ERROR_PG_RUNNING || Cannot restore because PostgreSQL server is running. ||
|| 26 || ERROR_PID_BROKEN || postmaster.pid file is broken. ||


= Outer Script =

  * This is the script to getting snapshot and mounting file systems.
  * If you want to add outer scripts, you shold make your script corresponding outer script interface according to referring manuals of the storage. 
  * Please refer "Interface Specification" about what you shold make.
  * Outer script performs some operation for getting several snapshots in a time execution.
  * If you want to use outer script, you shold set the script in backup catalog directory and rename it to "snapshot_script".
  * A sample outer script is released for LVM(Logical Volume Manager). 

== Commands Specification ==
{{{
$ ${BACKUP_PATH}/snapshot_script { split | resync | mount | umount | freeze | unfreeze } [cleanup]
}}}

  * Input
    ** first argument { split | resync | mount | umount | freeze | unfreeze }
      ** identifier for performing
    ** second argument {{{[cleanup]}}}
      ** If you specified "cleanup", error occuring doesn't stop the process. just output warning messages.
      ** this argument is for resync, umount, unfreeze only.

  * Output
    ** Making snapshot volume by performing "split" operation.
    ** Freezing filesystem I/O by performing "freeze" operation.
    ** Mounting to snapshot volume by performing "mount" operation.
    ** standard output
      ** output tablespace name in the snapshot by performing "split" operation.
